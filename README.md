# Coding exercises
Here I have some coding exercises in 3 different languages: `JavaScript`, `Python` and `shell script` that I have been using to teach my sister.

**Average**

- This function should return the average for a given numbers list of integers

**Birthday**

- This function should return the weekday for a given date in format YYYY-MM-DD.
- An additional feature is a second param for language which should be handled by the function

This list will increase during next lessons.
